## Style Guidelines

This project will be primarily using [airbnb react](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) as our main style guides when implementing components.This is to create code consistency and readability.

# Storybook

Storybook is an open-source tool that provides a sandbox to develop and visualize components in isolation. See the [Storybook site](https://storybook.js.org/) for more information about the tool.

COMMONS-UI uses Storybook to view and work with the UI components developed in the COMMONS-UI packages.

Run locally in your development environment running: `yarn start` from the top-level Gutenberg directory.
